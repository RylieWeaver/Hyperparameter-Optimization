# Hyperparameter-Optimization
Some preliminary investigation into genetic algorithms before implementing them into the CANDLE and IMPROVE projects Hyperparameter Optimization in association w/ Argonne National Lab

The Genetic Algorithm is implemented using the DEAP python library (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python). More information can be found here:
